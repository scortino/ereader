Reads EViews workfile (.wf1) into a Pandas DataFrame. Although it's been tested on a handful of files, the code is based on [this](http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/eviews_format/) partial reverse-engineering information and is therefore provided with no guarantee it will work with all EViews workfiles. While the code is already commented, I might add further details to this README.md in the future.
